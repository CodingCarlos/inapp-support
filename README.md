**WARNING**: This is not a stable version. We are currently developing things, and it may have heavy security problems, have parts not finished, have parts broken, or crash unexpectedly. I do not recommend you to use it in production yet.

# inapp-support
HTML5 inApp support chat using your own firebase account. Just add your firebase config (as in firebase console is given to you), and add to your code:

```html
<!-- Include IASChat -->
<script src="js/chat.js"></script>

<!-- Main working -->
<script type="text/javascript">	
window.onload = function() {
  window.IASChat = new IASChat({
    uid: '33g07u1sDg44aa12', // The user id here
    name: 'CodingCarlos',    // The user name here
    button: true
  });
};
</script>
```

And it's done!

---

## Configuration
### client js
To configure the chat, just use the object passed on IASChat instantiation.

 - uid: String User id (if you put a Number, shall work, but I can't promise you that it will work as expected)
 - name: String User name
 - button: Boolean Show or not the fab button to open the chat
 
 Next up!
 
  - User pictures
  - Topbar background color
  - Topbar text color
  - Topbar default image
  - Topbar default "support" name
  - Fab background color
  - Fab icon color

### firebase
Create a new firebase project, and add the configuration script to your code, if possible, before including chat.js.

Right now, I'm not sure how to configure the security of firebase well, but I will do my research

## Support panel
Take the code in demo/support.html and add to your existent panel. Yes, so easy. Yes, I've done very little work on this part.

### Assign user to supporter
For now, no assignation is done. In v0.1, supporter wil got assigned any chat that answer. Unassigned chats will appear to all supporters. To change assignation, for now, you have to do it in firebase console. In v0.2 the actual supporter will be able to change the supporter assigned to the chat.

### Add supporters
Will be a beautifull form to do that in the 0.2. Now, initialize the user and done.

### Secure the panel
Yes, I shall work on this.

  
## Responsiveness
Nope, right now is not desktop/tablet responsive, just mobile, but I'm doing my best to add larger screen support. 

## Contribute
You can use this code as you like. If you find a bug, or want to ask for a feature, just open an issue, and we'll do our best. If you can fix it, do a pull request to ``dev`` branch, and we promise to review it as fast as possible to merge it. 

If you are new on this open source world, here is a short guide about how to make a pull request to contribute:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/CodingCarlos/inapp-support/fork) then clone `git clone git@github.com:your-username/inapp-support.git` inapp-support repository
2. Create a new branch in your personally forked repo, with a name similar to your edits, such as `fix-whatever`
3. Make your edits inside your new branch
4. Commit them and push them back to your personal github fork
5. Make a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/CodingCarlos/inapp-support/compare/) on the inapp-support repo. Point your branch to the `dev` inapp-support branch and submit.

I will do my best to review and accept the commit as soon as possible.
